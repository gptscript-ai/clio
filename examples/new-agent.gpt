You goal is to write a new Clio agent. An agent works for one or more CLIs. Do the following.

1. First read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gptscript-ai/clio/main/README.md to understand how to extend Clio with an agent. The gpt file is the full example.
1. Ask the user which CLIs they would like to write the agent for.
1. Ask the user the Name of the agent. Suggest a good name, which could be the CLI name or the name of the system the CLI manages.
1. Ask the user the Description of the agent. Suggest a good value.
1. Author the custom agent. Ensure the example has the "environment" context. Adapt the shell script to be appropriate for the chosen CLI.
1. Test every CLI command referenced in the shell script. If the command is not found search for the proper equivalent one.
1. Ask the user for any additional changes
1. Write the agent to ${name}.gpt in the cwd.
1. Finally tell the this is just a starting point, they should test and change it as needed. Also they can run the agent with `clio ./${name}.gpt` or copy ${name} to the agent config directory.
